        <h1 class="heading">Treatment Approach</h1>
        <p class="block">Melanie has worked extensively with people at all levels of function and stages in their
            recovery; from those with multiple and complex needs to those at a higher-level of functioning, needing
            support to successfully transition back into the community, workforce or studies. <br><br>

            Melanie’s treatment focuses on maximising functional return of people’s communication, social and swallowing
            abilities. She is passionate about assisting her clients to develop skills to maintain meaningful
            friendships to improve their quality of life.

            She enjoys working collaboratively with other therapists, families and support teams in order to achieve
            meaningful, motivating and participant-centred goals.

            Melanie has supported a number of her clients to provide education to young drivers and traffic offenders
            through various road safety programmes.
            <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="quote">“I believe that communication skills cut across everything we do. Effective communication
            enables us to express our wishes and choices, self-advocate and make friends. As a speech pathologist, my
            role is to assist my clients to regain some control over their world after they have a serious injury or illness when
            they are particularly vulnerable. I am passionate about assisting people to express themselves to the best of
            their abilities, despite the challenges they face”. </p>
